This is my PM566 Final Project website home. The website is online at https://giulietk.github.io/Pm566-Final-Project/.

The website for this project includes 3 interactive graphs, each with a brief description, and a link to a downloadable PDF of the full report.
The PDF is also avaliable for download in the docs folder as Final-Project.pdf

Data is made avaliable by the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2017-March 2020 as P_DR1TOT.xpt. This dataset is also avaliable for download in the data folder above.
