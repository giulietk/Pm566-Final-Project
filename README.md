This is my PM566 Final Project website home. The website is online at https://giulietk.github.io/Pm566-Final-Project/.
The website for this project includes 3 interactive graphs and a brief description in addition to a downloadable PDF of the full report.
The PDF is also avaliable for download in the docs folder as Pm-Final-Project.pdf

Data is made avaliable by the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 2017-March 2020 as P_DR1TOT.xpt. This dataset is also avaliable for download in the data folder above.
