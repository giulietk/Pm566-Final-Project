This is the data file for this project. It was collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  to estimate the dietary intake over the 24-hour period prior to the interview of Americans 1 year or older. This particular dataset is a combination of data collected in the 2017-2018 cycle and 2019-March 2020 since the NHANES program was suspended in March of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dietary interview component of this survey is called "What We Eat in America" (WWEIA) and data is collected using the USDA's Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM). All participants are eligible for two survey interviews, the first of which is recorded in person at the Mobile Examination Center, and the second is conducted over the phone 3 to 10 days later. This data set includes dietary information from the first interview and is a log of the total energy and nutrient intakes, including the macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and vitamins, from foods and beverages within the previous 24-hours.
